# ArbLink — AmiExpress rlogin Door

An AmiExpress BBS door that bridges a caller to an external door server over the
`rlogin` protocol. Written in C and cross-compiled on Windows for m68k-AmigaOS.

A standalone command-line rlogin client (`rlogincli`) is also included, built from
the same shared transport layer (work in progress).

---

## Status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| `arblink` door | Working — validated under live AmiExpress/WinUAE testing |
| `rlogincli` CLI client | Partial — connects and shows remote output; **no local console input** |

### Background

The project began as my attempt to get my head around Amiga E programming again (`old_e/`).
That version is only partially working. It has been retired and used as a reference in the new "C" adventure.

The current C rewrite corrects all of the issues I was having and has been confirmed working
through AmiExpress as an XIM door.

---

## Requirements

- AmiExpress with AEDoor available
- `bsdsocket.library` (AmiTCP-style TCP stack)

---

## Build

Cross-compile on Windows using vbcc for m68k-AmigaOS:

```batch
build.bat
```

| Output | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `arblink` | `rlogindoor.c` + modules | AmiExpress door binary |
| `rlogincli` | `rlogincli.c` + shared transport | Standalone CLI rlogin client - **Not Working** |

The build script requires vbcc (`vc`) on the system PATH and the local AmigaOS
include trees at:

```
C:\amiga-dev\targets\m68k-amigaos\include
C:\amiga-dev\targets\m68k-amigaos\posix\include
```

---

## Installation

Copy `arblink` to the "DOORS" location on the Amiga and set it as an XIM command
in AmiExpress. Place `rlogindoor.cfg` in the same drawer (`PROGDIR:`).
Create an appropriate ".info" file in your "COMMANDS" folder to launch it.

---

## Configuration

Copy `rlogindoor.cfg.example` to `rlogindoor.cfg` and edit as needed.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | — | Remote rlogin server hostname or IP |
| `port` | `513` | Remote port (`login` is accepted as an alias for `513`) |
| `username_prefix` | — | Prefix prepended to the caller name before sending — see note below |
| `remote_user` | — | Override remote user name entirely; leave blank to use the prefixed caller name |
| `terminal_type` | `ansi` | Terminal type sent in the rlogin handshake |
| `terminal_speed` | `19200` | Terminal speed sent in the handshake |
| `terminal_columns` | `80` | Terminal width |
| `terminal_rows` | `24` | Terminal height |
| `disable_paging` | `0` | Set to `1` to suppress AmiExpress paging prompts during the session |
| `debug_enabled` | `0` | Set to `1` to enable file-based debug logging |
| `debug_log` | `rlogindoor.log` | Log file path (e.g. `RAM:arblink.log`) |

**Username prefix note:** The prefix is designed for shared multi-BBS door server
setups where multiple BBS systems connect to the same remote door server. The prefix
acts as a unique tag per BBS so the server can distinguish callers across systems.
For example, with `username_prefix=V4S`, a caller named `Alex` is sent to the remote
server as `V4SAlex`.

## Acknowledgements

AI assistance (Claude, Anthropic) was used during development for:

- Diagnosing the unresolved issues in the original E prototype — in particular the blocking
  `HotKey()` call, the unsafe handshake buffer, and inconsistent socket library ownership
- Proposing and extraction of `rlogincli` as a standalone side project
  built from the shared transport layer

## Version

`1.34.01` — major line 1, build number carries forward from the last E prototype (34),
`.01` is the first working C build.
